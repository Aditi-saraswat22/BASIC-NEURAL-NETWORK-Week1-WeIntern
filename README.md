# BASIC-NEURAL-NETWORK-Week1-WeIntern
# Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Network (From Scratch)

## Description
This project implements a simple feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. No machine learning frameworks were used.

## Key Features
- One hidden layer neural network
- ReLU and Softmax activation functions
- Cross-entropy loss
- Backpropagation implemented manually
- Training and test accuracy evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (only for dataset loading)

## Results
- Training Accuracy: ~95–97%
- Test Accuracy: ~94–96%

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how neural networks work internally, including forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation without relying on high-level libraries.
